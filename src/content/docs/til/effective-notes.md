## Context

Notes get stale quickly when they are too long or too generic.

## Key learnings

- Write the problem first, then the solution.
- Add one concrete example.
- Include links to source material.
- End with a quick action to apply the learning.

## Example

```markdown
Problem: CI pipeline fails on cold cache.
Solution: cache npm deps by lockfile hash.
Action: update workflow cache key this week.
```
