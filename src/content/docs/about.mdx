description: Why this knowledge base exists and how notes are written.

Hi, I am `hieulw`.

This site is my personal knowledge base. I use it to capture what I learn while building software and operating systems.

## What you will find here

- Practical notes from real tasks
- Small examples I can reuse later
- Checklists for repeated workflows
- Links to useful references

## How I write notes

Each note is short and follows this flow:

1. Context
2. Key learnings
3. Example
4. References

This keeps notes easy to scan and easy to update over time.
