## Context

Without a weekly review, repeated mistakes can look like random issues.

## Key learnings

- Track one win, one challenge, and one improvement.
- Keep actions specific and measurable.
- Review outcomes at the start of the next week.

## Example

```text
Win: Improved PR turnaround from 3 days to 1 day.
Challenge: Too many context switches from ad-hoc requests.
Next action: reserve two no-meeting focus blocks next week.
```
